Welcome! If you are reading this, you are probably interested in starting a Zooniverse project using the Project Builder. Perhaps your images/subjects are prepared, you have a compelling research case, and you know what information you are looking for... all that you need now is to process those images and turn them into data, so that you can make the breakthrough of the century in your field. We say, great\u2014you\u2019ve come to the right place! First, however, take a moment to consider the Zooniverse slogan: People-Powered Research . Why is that so important? Well, because it\u2019s true. Simply put, volunteers are the lifeblood of a Zooniverse project , and only with their efforts can your project accomplish its research goals. Your project\u2019s amateur researchers are not a data-processing machine: they are people with many options for how to spend their free time, who (may) freely choose to help you. Thus, it is critical to the success of your project that you engage your participants as much as possible. Volunteer engagement takes many forms, and may differ from project to project. To get you started, this document contains a set of basic \"best practices\" for engagement that new research teams should consider as they create and manage a project. These best practices were identified by experienced volunteers, researchers, and Zooniverse staff at a Sept. 2015 workshop, funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, at Chicago\u2019s Adler Planetarium. They are organized into three categories: Building your project to be appealing and volunteer-friendly. Launching your project and recruiting volunteers. Managing your project from post-launch to completion. Although these best practices are for the most part non-mandatory suggestions , they are drawn from significant experience, and we strongly recommend reading through this entire article before you start building your project! It may be useful to refer back to it later on as well.

Building, launching, and (especially) maintaining an engaging project takes time and sustained effort. Before you even start, your project team should be prepared to remain personally involved with your project for its entire lifespan. Reduce your individual workloads by delegating responsibilities to each member of your team. Understand your goals and expectations from the start. The end goal of a Zooniverse project generally should be to produce new research from volunteers\u2019 efforts. Be sure that your project design and messaging reflect the tangible goal that you are working towards. Consider reaching out to Zooniverse volunteers early on. Some of our most successful projects in terms of engagement have been those built in cooperation with volunteers. You might find volunteers interested in helping with your build on Zooniverse Talk\u2019s Project Building board . Keep everything short and simple. Your volunteers are smart, but most will not be experts. Avoid jargon and complex questions. Make the tasks fairly basic, and consolidate them when possible. Ideally, a 10- or 12-year-old child should be able to understand and do your project. Help text should help volunteers answer the question. When volunteers click \"Need Some Help?\" they are seeking help in answering that question. There are other areas in the project to describe your research; the help text is for visual examples and question-specific guidance. You can (and should) discuss your research goals in depth on your project\u2019s Research page. Use images as examples wherever possible. Visual examples of what you are asking volunteers to look for are extremely important to have in addition to text descriptions. Consider offering a variety of examples of \"correctly\" classified data to educate volunteers. Create informative content and a solid name and tagline. The title of your project should be short and punchy; your tagline should try to \"hook\" volunteers. Use your static pages (Research, FAQs, etc.) to explain your project clearly and resolve the most common questions about it. Be prepared to test and make changes. However good your project\u2019s \"first draft\" is, volunteer testing (including the formal Zooniverse \"project review\" stage) will reveal things to alter. You should first test your project with contacts, friends, or family who are trying it for the first time\u2014and watch them as they do it! Study your feedback and raw data, and make adjustments. Make your project visually clean and interesting. Choose imagery that fits your project\u2019s aesthetic and that you have permission to use. Make sure that text is readable over your background.

The first few days following the launch of your project are critical. Thousands of volunteers will be trying the project and deciding if they want to become regular classifiers. Your classifications per day will likely spike, then fall and level out; your level of long-term engagement depends largely on what you do during launch. Write an amazing newsletter. For new Zooniverse projects, a newsletter will announce the project to over a million volunteers; it can bring huge traffic. Your newsletter should be short and personal, clearly describing the project and its goals. Include links to the project and associated sites (blog, social media, etc.).

Also see if you can leverage connections with related organizations for promotion. \"Talk\" to your volunteers! One appealing element of the Zooniverse is that volunteers can engage directly with professional researchers on the Talk discussion boards. Your presence in these first few days is especially important. By answering questions, you\u2019re helping volunteers feel more comfortable and laying the foundation for those volunteers to teach future newcomers. Prepare your blog, social media, and Talk, and be active. These are critical for developing deeper engagement, especially during your launch. Make sure that several boards are set up on Talk and that research team members are prepared to quickly respond to volunteers. During launch, consider daily blog posts and up to five posts per day on social-media accounts. Have a plan to identify and appoint moderators. Moderators have additional authority on Talk and are a resource for new volunteers. They are appointed by you\u2014typically after asking them personally. Choose mods wisely. You might start with a volunteer who is a mod on another project, then add first-timers later. Be sure that your moderators understand your expectations. Expect things to go wrong, and be ready to fix them. In the attention that your project receives shortly after launch, you may discover additional issues that you will need to address immediately. Broken projects, or ones with messaging issues, do not engage and retain volunteers well. Update your FAQ with questions that you find yourself frequently responding to. Plan your transition from launch to operating your project. After about a week, the launch frenzy will subside and less of your time will be required.

Send occasional reminder emails to your volunteers. Sometimes volunteers do forget about projects. The Zooniverse Communications team can help you send newsletters to your volunteers. Newsletters are proven to bring people back to projects and boost classifications. Give people a reason to join your community. Volunteers who discuss your project on Talk, social media, etc. often remain more devoted. You may be able to entice more people to do this if, in addition to your posting regularly, you give them a specific purpose.

Consider giving volunteers more ways to contribute. Some Zooniverse volunteers have conducted in-depth data analyses, written sorting algorithms, and become co-authors with researchers on peer-reviewed papers. Volunteers can also help with blogs and social media. End your project and do right by your volunteers. When your project has been completed, thank your volunteers and explain what happens next.

Log in to your Zooniverse account. Click on \"Build a Project\" and click \"Create a New Project\". Enter your project details in the pop-up that appears. You\u2019ll then be taken to a \u201cProject Details\u201d page where you can add further basic information. Add more information about your project via the blue tabs on the left-hand side of the project builder page. Guidance for each of these sections is provided on the page itself. If you have data to upload, add your subjects via the \u201cSubject Sets\u201d tab of the Project Builder (detailed instructions are provided here ), Next, create your workflow. Click on the \u201cWorkflow\u201d tab in the navigation bar on the left-hand side of the page. Use the \u201cNew workflow\u201d button to create a workflow. Multiple workflows can be created. Once you\u2019ve created a workflow, the \"Associated Subject Sets\" section allows you to link your workflow to your subject sets. If you have no subjects, go to the \u201cSubject Sets\u201d tab and upload your data (see step 5 above). Hit the \"Test this workflow\" button to see how your project looks. Explore your project to figure out what works and what doesn't. Make changes, then refresh your project page to test these out. Guidelines on how to design your project to maximize engagement and data quality are provided on the Policies page . When you are happy with your project, set it to \u201cPublic\u201d on the \u201cVisibility\u201d tab. Use the \u201cApply for review\u201d button to submit it to the Zooniverse team for review. Navigating the Project Builder On the left-hand side of the project builder you will see a number of tabs which can be divided into three key sections; \u201cProject\u201d, \u201cWorkflows\u201d and \u201cSubject Sets\u201d. These are terms you'll see a lot, and they have specific meanings in the Zooniverse. Project is pretty self-explanatory; Galaxy Zoo and Penguin Watch are examples of Zooniverse projects that could be built using the project builder. Workflows are sequences of tasks that volunteers are asked to do. Subject sets are collections of data (typically images) that volunteers are asked to perform tasks on. For more Zooniverse definitions, check out the Glossary page . Project The tabs listed below are where you enter descriptive information for your project. Project Details: Here you can add information that generates a home page for your project. Start by naming and describing your project, add a logo and background image. About: Here you can add all sorts of additional pages, including Research, Team, Results, Education, and FAQ Collaborators: Add people to your team. You can specify their roles so that they have access to the tools they need (such as access to the project before it's public). Field Guide: A field guide is a place to store general project-specific information that volunteers will need to understand in order to complete classifications and talk about what they're seeing. Tutorial: This is where you create tutorials to show your users how to contribute to your project. Media: Add images you need for your project pages (not the images you want people to classify!) Visibility: Set your project's \"state\" - private or public, live or in development, and apply for review by the Zooniverse. You can also activate or deactivate specific workflows on this page. Talk: Create and manage discussion boards for your project. Data Exports: Access your raw and aggregated classification data, subject data, and comments from Talk. Workflows A workflow is the sequence of tasks volunteers are asked to perform. For example, you might want to ask volunteers to answer questions about your images, or to mark features in your data, or both. The workflow tab is where you define those tasks and set the order in which volunteers are asked to do them. Your project might have multiple workflows (if you want to set different tasks for different image sets). See the detailed Workflow section for more information. Subjects A subject is a unit of data to be analyzed. A single subject can include more than one image. A \u201csubject set\u201d consists of both the \"manifest\" (a list of the subjects and their properties), and the images themselves. Subjects can be grouped into different sets if useful for your research. See the Subject Details section for more on subjects. Project building in detail Detailed instructions on how to use the pages described above. Project details Name : The project name is the first thing people will see and it will show up in the project URL. Try to keep it short and sweet. Avatar : Pick an avatar image for your project. This will represent your project on the Zooniverse home page. It can also be used as your project's brand. It's best if it's recognizable even as a small icon. To add an image, either drag and drop or click to open your file viewer. For best results, use a square image of not more than 50KB, but at minimum 100x100 pixels. Background : This image will be the background for all of your project pages, including your project's front page. It should be relatively high resolution and you should be able to read text written across it. To add an image, either drag and drop or click to open your file viewer. For best results, use images of at least 1 megapixel, no larger than 256 KB. Most people's screens are not much bigger than 1300 pixels across and 750 pixels high, so if your image is a lot bigger than this you may find it doesn't look the way you expect. Feel free to experiment with different sizes on a \"typical\" desktop, laptop or mobile screen. Description : This should be a one-line call to action for your project. This will display on your landing page and, if approved, on the Zooniverse home page. Some volunteers will decide whether to try your project based on reading this, so try to write short text that will make people actively want to join your project. Introduction : Add a brief introduction to get people interested in your project. This will display on your project's front page. Note this field renders markdown , so you can format the text. You can make this longer than the Description, but it's still probably best to save much longer text for areas like the About, Research Case or FAQ tabs. Workflow Description: A workflow is a set of tasks a volunteer completes to create a classification. Your project might have multiple workflows (if you want to set different tasks for different subject image sets). Add text here when you have multiple workflows and want to help your volunteers decide which one they should do. Checkbox: Volunteers choose workflow: If you have multiple workflows, check this to let volunteers select which workflow they want to work on; otherwise, they'll be served randomly. Researcher Quote: This text will appear on the project landing page alongside an avatar of the selected researcher. It\u2019s a way of communicating information to your volunteers, highlighting specific team members, and getting volunteers enthusiastic about participating. Announcement Banner: This text will appear as a banner at the top of all your project\u2019s pages. Only use this when you\u2019ve got a big important announcement to make! Many projects use this to signal the end of a beta review, or other major events in a project\u2019s life cycle. Discipline Tag: Enter or select one or more discipline tags to identify which field(s) of research your project belongs to. These tags will determine the categories your project will appear under on the main Zooniverse projects page, if your project becomes a full Zooniverse project. Other Tags: Enter a list of additional tags to describe your project separated by commas to help users find your project. External and Social Links: Adding an external link will add an entry in an External Project Links section that appears at the bottom of the project landing page. Adding a social link will add an entry in the same section along with an appropriate media icon in the link list. You can rearrange the displayed order among external links and social links by clicking and dragging on the left gray tab next to each link in the project builder interface. Checkbox: Private project: On \"private\" projects, only users with specified project roles can see or classify on the project. We strongly recommend you keep your project private while you're still editing it. Share it with your team to get feedback by adding them in the Collaborators area (linked at the left-hand side of the Project Builder). Team members you add can see your project even if it's private. Once your project is public, anyone with the link can view and classify on it. About This section contains pages where you can enter further information for Research, Team, Results, Education and FAQ. All of these pages use Markdown to format text and display images. Research: Use this section to explain your research to your audience in as much detail as you'd like. Explaining your motivation to volunteers is critical for the success of your project \u2013 please fill in this page (it will display even if you don\u2019t)! Team: Introduce the members of your team, and the roles they play in your project. Results: Share results from your project with volunteers and the public here. This page will only display if you add content to it. Education: On this page, you can provide resources for educators and students to use alongside your project, such as course syllabi, pedagogical tools, further reading, and instructions on how the project might be used in an educational context. This page will only display if you add content to it. FAQ: Add details here about your research, how to classify, and what you plan to do with the classifications. This page can evolve as your project does so that your active community members have a resource to point new users to. This page will only display if you add content to it. Collaborators Here you can add people to your team. You can specify their roles so that they have access to the tools they need (such as access to the project before it's public). Owner: The owner is the original project creator. There can be only one. Collaborator: Collaborators have full access to edit workflows and project content, including deleting some or all of the project. Expert: Experts can enter \u201cgold mode\u201d to make authoritative gold standard classifications that will be used to validate data quality. Researcher: Members of the research team will be marked as researchers on \u201cTalk\". Moderator: Moderators have extra privileges in the community discussion area to moderate discussions. They will also be marked as moderators on \u201cTalk\". Tester: Testers can view and classify on your project to give feedback while it\u2019s still private. They cannot access the project builder. Translator: Translators will have access to the project builder as well as the translation site, so they can translate all of your project text into a different language. Field Guide A field guide is a place to store general project-specific information that volunteers will need to understand in order to complete classifications and talk about what they're seeing. It's available anywhere in your project, accessible via a tab on the right-hand side of the screen. Information can be grouped into different sections, and each section should have a title and an icon. Content for each section is rendered with Markdown , so you can include any media you've uploaded for your project there. Tutorial In this section, you can create a step-by-step tutorial to show your users how to use your project. You can upload images and enter text to create each step of the tutorial. You can add as many steps as you want, but keep your tutorial as short as possible so volunteers can start classifying as soon as possible. In some cases, you might have several different workflows, and will therefore need several different tutorials. In the Workflows tab, you can specify which tutorial shows for the workflow a volunteer is on. Media You can upload your own media to your project (such as example images for your Help pages or Tutorial) so you can link to it without an external host. To start uploading, drop an image into the grey box (or click \u201cSelect files\u201d to bring up your file browser and select a file). Once the image has uploaded, it will appear above the \"Add an image\" box. You can then copy the Markdown text beneath the image into your project, or add another image. Visibility This page is where you decide whether your project is public and whether it's ready to go live. Project State and Visibility: Set your project to \u201cPrivate\u201d or \u201cPublic\u201d. Only the assigned collaborators can view a private project. Anyone with the URL can access a public project. Here, you can also choose whether your project is in \u201cDevelopment\u201d, or \u201cLive\u201d. Note: in a live project, active workflows are locked and can no longer be edited. Beta Status: Here, you will find a checklist of tasks that must be complete for your project to undergo beta review. Projects must complete review in order to launch as full Zooniverse projects and be promoted as such. Once these tasks are complete, click \u201cApply for review\u201d. Workflow Settings: You will see a list of all workflows created for the project. You can set the workflows to \u201cActive\u201d, choose what metric to measure for completeness statistics, and whether those statistics should be shown on your project\u2019s Stats Page.For more information on the different project stages, see our Project Builder policies . Talk \u201cTalk\u201d is the name for the discussion boards attached to your project. On your Talk, volunteers will be able to discuss your project and subjects with each other, as well as with you and your project\u2019s researchers. Maintaining a vibrant and active Talk is important for keeping your volunteers engaged with your project. Conversations on Talk also can lead to additional research discoveries. You can use this page to set up the initial Talk boards for your project. We highly recommend first activating the default subject-discussion board, which hosts a single dedicated conversation for each subject. After that, you can add additional boards, where each board will host conversation about a general topic. Example boards might include: \u201cAnnouncements,\u201d \u201cProject Discussion,\u201d \u201cQuestions for the Research Team,\u201d or \u201cTechnical Support.\u201d Data Exports In this section you can request data exports for your Project Data (CSV format) and Talk Data (JSON format). Note that the Zooniverse will process at most 1 of each export within a 24-hour period and some exports may take a long time to process. We will email you when they are ready. For examples of how to work with the data exports see our Data Digging code repository . Workflow Details Note that a workflow with fewer tasks is easier for volunteers to complete. We know from surveys of our volunteers that many people classify in their limited spare time, and sometimes they only have a few minutes. Longer, more complex workflows mean each classification takes longer, so if your workflow is very long you may lose volunteers. Workflow title: Give your workflow a short, but descriptive name. If you have multiple workflows and give volunteers the option of choosing which they want to work on, this Workflow title will appear on a button instead of \"Get started!\" Version: Version indicates which version of the workflow you are on. Every time you save changes to a workflow, you create a new version. Big changes, like adding or deleting questions, will change the version by a whole number: 1.0 to 2.0, etc. Smaller changes, like modifying the help text, will change the version by a decimal, e.g. 2.0 to 2.1. The version is tracked with each classification in case you need it when analyzing your data. Tasks: There are two main types of tasks: questions and drawing. For question tasks, the volunteer chooses from a list of answers but does not mark or draw on the image. In drawing tasks, the volunteer marks or draws directly on the image using tools that you specify. They can also give sub-classifications for each mark. Note that you can set the first task from the drop-down menu. Main Text: Describe the task, or ask the question, in a way that is clear to a non-expert. The wording here is very important, because you will in general get what you ask for. Solicit opinions from team members and testers before you make the project public: it often takes a few tries to reach the combination of simplicity and clarity that will guide your volunteers to give you the inputs you need. You can use markdown in the main text. Help Text: Add text and images for a pop-up help window. This is shown next to the main text of the task in the main classification interface, when the volunteer clicks a button asking for help. You can use markdown in this text, and link to other images to help illustrate your description. The help text can be as long as you need, but you should try to keep it simple and avoid jargon. One thing that is useful in the help text is a concise description of why you are asking for this information. Create Tasks Create tasks with the \"Add a task\" button. Delete tasks with the \"Delete this task\" button under the \u201cChoices\u201d box. Task Content Tasks can be Questions, Drawings or Transcription. All types have \"Main Text\" boxes where you can ask your questions or tell users what to draw, as well as provide additional support for completing the task in the \"Help Text\" box. Questions Choices: This section contains all your answers. The key features of this section are: Required: if you select this, the user has to answer the question before moving on. Multiple: if you select this, the user can select more than one answer - use this for \"select all that apply\" type questions. Next Task: The \u201cNext task\u201d selection (which appears below the text box for each answer) describes what task you want the volunteer to perform next after they give a particular answer. You can choose from among the tasks you\u2019ve already defined. If you want to link a task to another you haven\u2019t built yet, you can come back and do it later (don\u2019t forget to save your changes). Drawing This section contains all the different things people can mark. We call each separate option a \"Tool\" and you can specify a label, colour, and tool type for each option. Check out the Aggregation documents to understand how multiple volunteer answers are turned into final shapes for your data analysis. The tool types are: bezier: an arbitrary shape made of point-to-point curves. The midpoint of each segment drawn can be dragged to adjust the curvature. circle: a point and a radius. column: a box with full height but variable width; this tool cannot be rotated. ellipse: an oval of any size and axis ratio; this tool can be rotated. line: a straight line at any angle. point: X marks the spot. polygon: an arbitrary shape made of point-to-point lines. rectangle: a box of any size and length-width ratio; this tool cannot be rotated. triangle: an equilateral triangle of any size and vertex distance from the center; this tool can be rotated. grid table: cells which can be made into a table for consecutive annotations. Transcription This section deals with projects which require user-generated text. Tasks can range from adding keywords or extracting metadata to full text transcriptions. Keyword tagging is helpful when teams want to create a list of all of the things volunteers see in a given image, to make that object more discoverable in a database or online collection. In these cases diversity of opinion is helpful. Setting a retirement rate of 5 to 10 people will help capture diverse opinions. Full text transcription is more cumbersome and diversity of opinion is less helpful. Teams are usually trying to capture exactly what is on a page, so it will help to set a relatively low retirement rate for each image (i.e. 3 or 5) and be very clear in the tutorial how you would like volunteers to transcribe. Should they preserve spelling and punctuation or modernize it? Zooniverse does not currently offer aggregated classifications for text subjects. We can only report what each user transcribed for each subject. Before embarking on a transcription project be sure you have in-house expertise or access to expertise for combining multiple independent transcriptions into a single reading that you could use for research or to upload into a library or museum catalogue or content management system. For more information on Project Builder Data, please visit our Data Digging code repository as well as our Data processing Talk board . Linking the workflow together Now that all the tasks have been created, we've got to string them together by specifying what happens next . Set your first task using the \"First Task\" drop-down menu below the \"Add Task\" button. Then, using the \u201cNext task\u201d drop-down under the \u201cChoices\u201d box, specify what comes next . In question tasks, you can specify different \"Next Tasks\" for each available answer (provided users can only select one answer). Multi-Image options: If your tasks require users to see multiple subjects per task (like on Snapshot Serengeti ), decide how users will see them. The Flipbook option means users have to press a button to switch between subjects, while separate frames mean that each subject will be visible for the duration of the classification task. Subject retirement: Decide how many people you want to complete each task. You can change this number at any point (particularly after beta review). We suggest starting out high, between 10 and 20. Subject Sets On this page, you can add groups of data to be classified. To do so, drag and drop items onto the drop zone in the browser and then upload. You can give each set a name so that you can easily distinguish between them. Subject sets can be pretty powerful, and sometimes complex. You can have a single subject set that you add to over time, or have multiple subject sets, say, from different years or places. You can have different subject sets for different workflows, but you don't have to. You can even have multiple images in a given subject. For more details and advice on creating and structuring subject sets and associated manifests, check out https://www.zooniverse.org/help/example and scroll down to DETAILS - Subject sets and manifest details, a.k.a. \u201cWhat is a manifest?\u201d Further Help If you'd like some further information, check out the documentation behind building Kitteh Zoo , that talks you through building this project in the Project Builder.\\n\\nIf this doesn't help, get in contact with the Zooniverse team via the contact page .","title":"How to create a project with our Project Builder"},{"location":"getting-started/#how-to-create-a-project-with-our-project-builder","text":"","title":"How to create a project with our Project Builder"},{"location":"getting-started/#a-quick-guide-to-building-a-project","text":"A brief overview of all the steps you need to complete to set up your project.

Big changes, like adding or deleting questions, will change the version by a whole number: 1.0 to 2.0, etc. Smaller changes, like modifying the help text, will change the version by a decimal, e.g. 2.0 to 2.1. The version is tracked with each classification in case you need it when analyzing your data. Tasks: There are two main types of tasks: questions and drawing. For question tasks, the volunteer chooses from a list of answers but does not mark or draw on the image. In drawing tasks, the volunteer marks or draws directly on the image using tools that you specify. They can also give sub-classifications for each mark. Note that you can set the first task from the drop-down menu. Main Text: Describe the task, or ask the question, in a way that is clear to a non-expert. The wording here is very important, because you will in general get what you ask for. Solicit opinions from team members and testers before you make the project public: it often takes a few tries to reach the combination of simplicity and clarity that will guide your volunteers to give you the inputs you need. You can use markdown in the main text. Help Text: Add text and images for a pop-up help window. This is shown next to the main text of the task in the main classification interface, when the volunteer clicks a button asking for help. You can use markdown in this text, and link to other images to help illustrate your description. The help text can be as long as you need, but you should try to keep it simple and avoid jargon. One thing that is useful in the help text is a concise description of why you are asking for this information.","title":"Workflow Details"},{"location":"getting-started/#create-tasks","text":"Create tasks with the \"Add a task\" button.

Tasks can range from adding keywords or extracting metadata to full text transcriptions. Keyword tagging is helpful when teams want to create a list of all of the things volunteers see in a given image, to make that object more discoverable in a database or online collection. In these cases diversity of opinion is helpful. Setting a retirement rate of 5 to 10 people will help capture diverse opinions. Full text transcription is more cumbersome and diversity of opinion is less helpful. Teams are usually trying to capture exactly what is on a page, so it will help to set a relatively low retirement rate for each image (i.e. 3 or 5) and be very clear in the tutorial how you would like volunteers to transcribe. Should they preserve spelling and punctuation or modernize it? Zooniverse does not currently offer aggregated classifications for text subjects. We can only report what each user transcribed for each subject. Before embarking on a transcription project be sure you have in-house expertise or access to expertise for combining multiple independent transcriptions into a single reading that you could use for research or to upload into a library or museum catalogue or content management system.

This tutorial will help walk you through the process, using Kitteh Zoo as an example. You can explore the actual project . If you'd like to read more on strategy on building and running a project, such as what to plan for when building your project and what to do after launch, check out the Best Practices pages . Getting Started To get started building, go to the Project Builder home page and log in to your Zooniverse account, then click the \"Build a Project\" button in the top right. Here you can see all of the projects you own and collaborate on. Click on \"Create a project\" to start building. Start building: Now you're in the Project Builder itself. This is where the magic happens. On the left-hand side, you've got your main menus: Project, Workflow, and Subjects. These are terms you'll see a lot, and they have specific meanings in the Zooniverse. Project is pretty self-explanatory; Galaxy Zoo, Penguin Watch, and of course, Kitteh Zoo, are all examples of Zooniverse projects that you could build using the project builder. A workflow is the sequence of tasks that you ask volunteers to do, and subjects are the things (usually images) that volunteers do those tasks on. Define your project. The first thing you'll want to do is fill in some basic information about your project on the Project Details page. Just click and type in the relevant boxes. We've added a short description that will be formatted using the markdown language. The avatar and background image for Kitteh Zoo are in this folder. Download these images to your computer. Now add these images by dragging and dropping or by clicking on the relevant boxes (like in the image above). You can come back and add more details at any time while building your project. Building a workflow This is where you build the tasks that volunteers actually do. When you first get to this page, you'll see there is a sample task (specifically a question) already in place. We want to create this: We'll start by replacing the sample text with our question, which asks people how many cats are in the image. We add more answers using the \"+\" button under the \"Yes\" answer. Use the screenshot below to fill in the workflow details (you may need to zoom in!) We added both text and images into the Help Text box using the markdown language ( learn more about markdown ). Here is the markdown for the help text: Tell us **how many cats** you see. You should include: - Actual cats (not drawn or simulated) - Cats of any species We will ask many people the same question about this image, so don't worry if you aren't absolutely sure. *Just give us your best guess.* Here are some examples of cats: ![Sink Cats Relax](http://zooniverse-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/bigblogfiles/cat_demo/cat_bloonet.jpg) ![Only 1 of these cats counts.](http://zooniverse-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/bigblogfiles/cat_demo/cat_valentina_a.jpg) ![Wet kitteh iz not amused](http://zooniverse-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/bigblogfiles/cat_demo/cat_joeltelling.jpg) And here are some examples of not-cats (you can ignore these): ![A sample of things that are not cats.](http://zooniverse-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/bigblogfiles/cat_demo/notcats.png) We can set subsequent tasks to depend on the answer to this question. Right now we haven't made any other tasks, so the only option is \"End of Classification.\" Once we create more tasks, we'll go back through and link them. Note that this question is required (people can't move on until they've answered it) and only one answer is allowed. Now we want to draw circles around the cat's faces and mark a point on their tails. Why? Because we can. (For your own project you'd obviously want to think carefully about the reasons for adding tasks to a workflow, and what you want to get from the answers/marks.) So under the Task list, we'll click on drawing . We're asking folks to draw (with ellipses) around the cats' faces, as well as mark their tail tips with a point. We've changed the color on the Cattail points so they stand out more too. As usual, the main text gives people basic instructions on what we want, and the help text provides some more explanation on how to do the task. In addition to marking all the cat faces, we want to know just how cute they are. So every time someone marks a cat-face, we've added a pop-up question to ask just that. Add this question by clicking on the sub-tasks button below the Type and Color task specifications. When building your own project, you can combine any number of tasks in any order. You can start with a drawing task instead of a question. You can add sub-tasks for any drawing tool you make. In general, keep in mind that people are more likely to complete more classifications if the workflow is short and simple. Try to keep the workflow as simple as possible to achieve your research goals, and definitely try to only request tasks that cannot be accurately accomplished by automated methods. Linking the workflow together Now that all the tasks have been created, we've got to string them together by specifying what happens next . Right now, this means you kind of need to work backwards. The drawing task is the last task in this workflow, so we'll leave the \"Next Task\" button as the default \"end of classification.\" But we'll have to go back to our first question. The first question, \"How many cats are in this image?\" only allows one answer, so you can specify the next task depending on the answer. If folks say \"None\" for the number of cats, the classification ends. But if they say there's at least one cat, then they go on to the next question. Upload subjects To really get started building a project, you need images to work with. Normally you would add your own images by clicking on the \"New Subject Set\" button on the left hand side of the screen. This is one of the trickier steps in project creation -- for the purposes of this tutorial you can simply copy the Kitteh Zoo subject set, but check out the next section \"Uploading subjects -- the nitty gritty\" if you want to practice the full approach. To do this go to the workflow you created and under the associated subject set section click on add an example subject set . You should now see the 'kittehs' subject set selected. CONGRATULATIONS! You should have successfully created Kitteh Zoo! To view it, got back to the Build a Project page (by clicking the button in the top right of the page) and then click on the view button next to the new project you have just made. Uploading subjects - the Nitty Gritty When you actually build your own project, there won't be an example set of images already loaded for you. Get started uploading a set of subjects for your project by clicking on the \"New Subject Set\" button on the left hand side of the screen. That will bring you to the Subject Uploader . If every subject you want classified is a single image, and if the image file name contains enough information for you to be able to precisely match the subject with the rest of your data later, then this is pretty easy: you can just drag and drop the images into the Subject Uploader (or click within the \"Upload Subjects\" box and choose the files in the pop-up menu) and it will automatically detect that it needs to make subjects out of each file. Much of the time, though, project builders need to keep some data associated with their images in the classification interface. For example, in Kitteh Zoo all the images are Creative Commons licensed and need to have attribution attached when they are displayed. With a simple file called a manifest , we can associate the needed information with each image. Below you can find more details about the manifest in the section DETAILS - Subject sets and manifest details, a.k.a. \"What is a manifest?\" For now we will assume the manifest is created and the files are ready. You can see an example manifest file in the \"Kitteh\" zip file . People often find it easiest to have all of the subject images in a single folder along with a manifest file; you will upload both at the same time. However you organize your files, pay attention to the details and keep records, as it may be important for your data analysis later (e.g. when you download your classifications of subjects and need to know how to correctly link those back to all the rest of your metadata). Click on the \"Upload Subjects\" box and navigate to the \"Kitteh\" folder you downloaded. The easiest thing to do is simply hit cmd + a (on Mac, or ctrl + a on Windows) to select everything in that folder. Note that the subject uploader ignores the excel file and the other folders. Click \"open\" to select those images and the manifest file for upload. The project uploader now indicates that the \"Cat project manifest.csv\" has 30 subjects for upload. (If we had more subjects to upload, we'd do them in batches of no more than 1,000 at a time.) Click \"Upload\" to start the process. When everything is uploaded, you'll see a list of all of the subjects. The numbers to the left are unique identifiers for each subject, and the icons to the right let you preview or delete each subject. Subject sets can be pretty powerful, and sometimes complex. You can have a single subject set that you add to over time, or have multiple subject sets, say, from different years or places. You can have different subject sets for different workflows, but you don't have to. You can even have multiple images in a given subject. For more details and advice on creating and structuring subject sets and associated manifests, check out the details section below. PROJECT BUILDER'S MANUAL \u2013 THE DETAILS Project : This holds all your project level details. The project name, the people involved, and all the extra content (e.g. text and pictures) you want to share, are all here. Project Details : This is your project's \"behind the scenes\" home page. Start off by naming and describing your project, add a logo and background image. Research Case, FAQ, Results, and Education : You can add a lot of information in these pages to help volunteers better understand the motivation for your project, the best approaches for classifying, and the outcomes of your project. Collaborators : Add people to your team and specify what their roles are so that they have the right access to the tools they need (including access to the project before it's public). Workflows : A workflow is the sequence of tasks that you're asking volunteers to perform. For example, you might want to ask volunteers to answer questions about your images, or to mark features in your data, or both. The workflow is where you define those tasks and set out the order in which the volunteers will do them. Your project might have multiple workflows (if you want to set different tasks for different image sets). Subjects : A subject is a unit of data to be analyzed. A subject can include one or more images that will be analyzed at the same time by volunteers. A subject set consists of a list of subjects (the \"manifest\") defining their properties, and the images themselves. Feel free to group subjects into sets in the way that is most useful for your research. Many projects will find it's best to just have all their subjects in 1 set, but not all: larger projects often find it essential to group subjects into multiple sets. DETAILS - Workflows Note that a workflow with fewer tasks will be easier for volunteers to complete. We know from surveys of our volunteers that many people classify in their limited spare time, and sometimes they only have a few minutes. Longer, more complex workflows mean each classification takes longer, so if your workflow is very long you may lose volunteers. Workflow Name : Give your workflow a short, but descriptive name. If you have multiple workflows and give volunteers the option of choosing which they want to work on, this name will appear on a button instead of \"Get started!\" Version : Version indicates which version of the workflow you are on. Every time you save changes to a workflow, you create a new version. Big changes, like adding or deleting questions, will change the version by the number to the left of the \".\": 1.0 to 2.0, etc. Smaller changes, like modifying the help text, will change the integer to the right of the \".\", e.g. 2.0 to 2.1. The version is tracked with each classification in case you need it when analyzing your data. Note: the version looks like a decimal number, but it is not : it is a string with two numbers separated by a \".\" character. So, for example, version 2.1 is not the same as version 2.10. Tasks : There are two main types of tasks: questions and drawing. For question tasks, the volunteer chooses from a list of answers but does not mark or draw on the image. In drawing tasks, the volunteer marks or draws directly on the image using tools that you specify. They can also give sub-classifications for each mark. Note that you can set the first task from the drop-down menu. Main Text : Describe the task, or ask the question, in a way that is clear to a non-expert. The wording here is very important, because you will in general get what you ask for. Solicit opinions from team members and testers before you make the project public: it often takes a few tries to reach the combination of simplicity and clarity that will guide your volunteers to give you the inputs you need. You can use markdown in the main text. Help Text : Add text and images for a pop-up help window. This is shown next to the main text of the task in the main classification interface, when the volunteer clicks a button asking for help. You can use markdown in this text, and link to other images to help illustrate your description. The help text can be as long as you need, but you should try to keep it simple and avoid jargon. One thing that is useful in the help text is a concise description of why you are asking for this particular information. This help information often overlaps with information in the Field Guide, but it is an opportunity to provide extra detail about each specific task. DETAILS - Project Details: Name : The project name is the first thing people will see and it will show up in the project URL. Try to keep it short and sweet. Avatar : Pick an avatar image for your project. This will represent your project on the Zooniverse home page. It can also be used as your project's brand. It's best if it's recognizable even as a small icon. To add an image, either drag and drop or click to open your file viewer. For best results, use a square image of not more than 50KB, but at minimum 100x100 pixels. Background : This image will be the background for all of your project pages, including your project's front page, which newcomers will see first. It should be relatively high resolution and you should be able to read text written across it. To add an image, either drag and drop or click to open your file viewer. For best results, use images of at least 1 megapixel, no larger than 256 KB. Most people's screens are not much bigger than 1300 pixels across and 750 pixels high, so if your image is a lot bigger than this you may find it doesn't look the way you expect. Feel free to experiment with different sizes on a \"typical\" desktop, laptop or mobile screen. Description : This should be a one-line call to action for your project. This will display on your landing page and, if approved, on the Zooniverse home page. Some volunteers will decide whether to try your project based on reading this, so try to write short text that will make people actively want to join your project. Introduction : Add a brief introduction to get people interested in your project. This will display on your project's front page. Note this field (renders markdown)[http://markdownlivepreview.com/], so you can format the text. You can make this longer than the Description, but it's still probably best to save much longer text for areas like the Research Case or FAQ tabs. Checkbox: Volunteers choose workflow : A workflow is a set of tasks a volunteer completes to create a classification. Your project might have multiple workflows (if you want to set different tasks for different image sets). Check this to let volunteers select which workflow they want to work on; otherwise, they'll be served workflow-subject pairs randomly. Checkbox: Private project : On \"private\" projects, only users with specified project roles can see or classify on the project. We strongly recommend you keep your project private while you're still working out its details. Share it with your team to get feedback by adding them in the Collaborators area (linked at the left). Team members you add can see your project even if it's private. Once your project is public, anyone with the link can view and classify on it. DETAILS - Additional Content Research, FAQ, Results, and Education : These pages are where you really get to share all the cool things about your project. All of these pages use Markdown (see link above) to format text and display images. Research : Explain your research case to your audience here in as much detail as you'd like. This page displays no matter what, since explaining your motivation to volunteers is critical for the success of your project! Results : Once your project has hit its stride, share the results of your project with your volunteers here. Volunteers really value feedback about how their inputs were used to help the research. This page will only display if you add content to it. FAQ : Add details here about your research, how to classify, and what you plan to do with the classifications. This page can evolve as your project does so that your active community members have a resource to point new users to. This page will only display if you add content to it. Education : If you are a researcher open to collaborating with educators you can state that here, include educational content, and describe how you'd like to help educators use your project. Also, if your project is primarily for educational purposes you can describe that here. This page will only display if you add content to it. DETAILS - Media You can upload your own media to your project (such as example images for your help pages) so you can link to it without an external host. To start uploading, drop an image into the box (or click it to bring up your file browser and select a file). Once the image has uploaded, it will appear above the \"Add an image\" box. You can then copy the markdown text beneath the image into your project, or add another image. DETAILS - Visibility This page is where you decide whether your project is public and whether it's ready to go live. For more information on the different project stages, see our project builder policies . DETAILS - Collaborators Add people to your team and specify what their roles are so that they have the right access to the tools they need (including access to the project before it's public). Owner : The owner is the original project creator. There can be only one. Collaborator : Collaborators have full access to edit workflows and project content, including deleting some or all of the project. Expert : Experts can enter \u201cgold mode\u201d to make authoritative gold standard classifications that will be used to validate data quality. Researcher : Members of the research team will be marked as researchers on \u201cTalk\" Moderator : Moderators have extra privileges in the community discussion area to moderate discussions. They will also be marked as moderators on \u201cTalk\". Tester : Testers can view and classify on your project to give feedback while it\u2019s still private. They cannot access the project builder. Translator : Translators will have access to the project builder as well as the translation site, so they can translate all of your project text into a different language. DETAILS - Subject sets and manifest details, a.k.a. \"What is a manifest?\" The condensed answer: A manifest is a file that tells our software how to combine the images you have into units of data (subjects) to be classified. The manifest also allows you to link your classifications back to the rest of your data. A manifest is formatted as a CSV file with 1 line per subject, with the names of images to be associated with a subject on each row (with additional information often included in other fields as well). There is an example in the \"Kitteh\" zip file . The full answer: What we call a \"manifest\" is really just a plain text file with a specific format to each line. To understand the format, let's start with the first few lines from the Kitteh Zoo manifest: image,!origin,link,attribution,license,#secret_description 6672150457_420d61007d_b.jpg,Flickr,https://www.flickr.com/photos/aigle_dore/6672150457,Moyan Brenn,Creative Commons - share adapt attribute,sleepy striped kitteh is unsuspecting of paparazzi 8300920648_d4a21bba59_z.jpg,Flickr,https://www.flickr.com/photos/aigle_dore/8300920648,Moyan Brenn,Creative Commons - share adapt attribute,grandfather kitteh has ear hair. a lot of it 6713782851_82fc8c73e5_z.jpg,Flickr,https://www.flickr.com/photos/hellie55/6713782851,hehaden,Creative Commons - share adapt attribute,juvenile kittehs practice break-in at the catnip factory The first line of the file is a header line that specifies the name of each of the manifest fields. In this case, our manifest has 6 fields (or columns), called \"image\", \"!origin\", \"link\", \"attribution\", \"license\" and \u201c#secret_description\u201d. They are separated by commas: this is what's known as a \"comma separated values\" file, or CSV file. After the first line, each row of the file contains information about 1 subject. The first field, which aligns with the \"image\" header, contains the name of the image that's associated with that subject. This field is critically important as it tells the project builder which images to make into subjects. All the other fields are optional, but in general having more information in the manifest is better. Most projects include additional information in the manifest that helps them match the classifications and subjects to the other data they need for their research. For example, many projects include a separate ID that they have generated and which can be used later as a unique identifier to match classification data to their own metadata (for other projects, the unique identifier is the filename). The additional information in the manifest can also be made available to volunteers as they classify or in the Talk discussion tool (some very keen volunteers find this extremely useful). Any fields with names that begin with \u201c#\u201d or \u201c//\u201d will never be shown to volunteers, such as the \u201c#secret_description\u201d field in Kitteh Zoo. These hidden fields will still be returned to you in the classification file, so you can use these to include information helpful to your research without worrying about whether it might affect the classifications themselves. There might be information that could helpful for the volunteers in discussions or further exploration in the Talk discsussion tool, but could bias the classifications if visible to volunteers while classifying. Any fields with names that begin with \"!\" will not be accessible to volunteers in the classification interface, but will be available on Talk after classification (such as the \u201c!origin\u201d field above). Information in fields that don\u2019t begin with a \u201c#\u201d, \u201c//\u201d, or '!' will always be accessible to volunteers in both the classification interface and the Talk discussion tool. For now, let\u2019s assume you\u2019re just including minimal information, like: my_own_id,the_image 1,kitteh_in_box.jpg 2,kitteh_stalking.jpg 3,kitteh_losing_balance.jpg Note the field names have changed from the previous example. That's because, aside from marking whether a field is hidden or not, it doesn't actually matter to the Zooniverse what the fields are called (or what order they\u2019re in), so you can name and order them according to whatever works best for your project. Using a manifest CSV file also makes it very easy to create subjects with multiple images: my_own_id,image1,image2 1,kitteh_in_box.jpg,kitteh_eating_box.jpg 2,kitteh_stalking.jpg,kitteh_pounced.jpg 3,kitteh_losing_balance.jpg,kitteh_falling_off_sofa.jpg If you upload this manifest plus the 6 images named in it, the Zooniverse software will create 3 subjects with 2 images each. When these subjects come up in the classification interface, volunteers will be able to flash between the images or switch between them manually. Later on, when these subjects are classified, the subject_id assigned by the project builder can be used with a subject export to match each classification back to this information. You can create a manifest file in a simple text editor (such as TextEdit or Notepad), although this method is prone to errors like missed or extra commas. People often find it easiest to create manifest files using spreadsheet software such as Google Sheets, iWork Numbers or Microsoft Excel. Creating and maintaining a manifest using a spreadsheet makes the manifest easy to read, and you can export it to CSV format when you're ready to upload your subjects. You can also open existing CSV files in spreadsheet software. Note: if you have a large subject set it may be cumbersome to manually create a manifest. We suggest using a command-line or other tool to copy-paste a directory list of files into a spreadsheet to help you get started.","title":"Example Project"},{"location":"getting-started/example/#example-project","text":"So you want to build a project using the Zooniverse Project Builder?

Project is pretty self-explanatory; Galaxy Zoo, Penguin Watch, and of course, Kitteh Zoo, are all examples of Zooniverse projects that you could build using the project builder. A workflow is the sequence of tasks that you ask volunteers to do, and subjects are the things (usually images) that volunteers do those tasks on.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting-started/example/#define-your-project","text":"The first thing you'll want to do is fill in some basic information about your project on the Project Details page. Just click and type in the relevant boxes. We've added a short description that will be formatted using the markdown language. The avatar and background image for Kitteh Zoo are in this folder. Download these images to your computer. Now add these images by dragging and dropping or by clicking on the relevant boxes (like in the image above). You can come back and add more details at any time while building your project.","title":"Define your project."},{"location":"getting-started/example/#building-a-workflow","text":"This is where you build the tasks that volunteers actually do. When you first get to this page, you'll see there is a sample task (specifically a question) already in place. We want to create this: We'll start by replacing the sample text with our question, which asks people how many cats are in the image. We add more answers using the \"+\" button under the \"Yes\" answer. Use the screenshot below to fill in the workflow details (you may need to zoom in!) We added both text and images into the Help Text box using the markdown language ( learn more about markdown ). Here is the markdown for the help text: Tell us **how many cats** you see. You should include: - Actual cats (not drawn or simulated) - Cats of any species We will ask many people the same question about this image, so don't worry if you aren't absolutely sure. *Just give us your best guess.* Here are some examples of cats: ![Sink Cats Relax](http://zooniverse-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/bigblogfiles/cat_demo/cat_bloonet.jpg) ![Only 1 of these cats counts.](http://zooniverse-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/bigblogfiles/cat_demo/cat_valentina_a.jpg) ![Wet kitteh iz not amused](http://zooniverse-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/bigblogfiles/cat_demo/cat_joeltelling.jpg) And here are some examples of not-cats (you can ignore these): ![A sample of things that are not cats.](http://zooniverse-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/bigblogfiles/cat_demo/notcats.png) We can set subsequent tasks to depend on the answer to this question. Right now we haven't made any other tasks, so the only option is \"End of Classification.\" Once we create more tasks, we'll go back through and link them. Note that this question is required (people can't move on until they've answered it) and only one answer is allowed. Now we want to draw circles around the cat's faces and mark a point on their tails. Why? Because we can. (For your own project you'd obviously want to think carefully about the reasons for adding tasks to a workflow, and what you want to get from the answers/marks.) So under the Task list, we'll click on drawing . We're asking folks to draw (with ellipses) around the cats' faces, as well as mark their tail tips with a point. We've changed the color on the Cattail points so they stand out more too. As usual, the main text gives people basic instructions on what we want, and the help text provides some more explanation on how to do the task. In addition to marking all the cat faces, we want to know just how cute they are. So every time someone marks a cat-face, we've added a pop-up question to ask just that. Add this question by clicking on the sub-tasks button below the Type and Color task specifications. When building your own project, you can combine any number of tasks in any order. You can start with a drawing task instead of a question. You can add sub-tasks for any drawing tool you make. In general, keep in mind that people are more likely to complete more classifications if the workflow is short and simple. Try to keep the workflow as simple as possible to achieve your research goals, and definitely try to only request tasks that cannot be accurately accomplished by automated methods.","title":"Building a workflow"},{"location":"getting-started/example/#linking-the-workflow-together","text":"Now that all the tasks have been created, we've got to string them together by specifying what happens next . Right now, this means you kind of need to work backwards. The drawing task is the last task in this workflow, so we'll leave the \"Next Task\" button as the default \"end of classification.\" But we'll have to go back to our first question. The first question, \"How many cats are in this image?\" only allows one answer, so you can specify the next task depending on the answer. If folks say \"None\" for the number of cats, the classification ends. But if they say there's at least one cat, then they go on to the next question.","title":"Linking the workflow together"},{"location":"getting-started/example/#upload-subjects","text":"To really get started building a project, you need images to work with. Normally you would add your own images by clicking on the \"New Subject Set\" button on the left hand side of the screen. This is one of the trickier steps in project creation -- for the purposes of this tutorial you can simply copy the Kitteh Zoo subject set, but check out the next section \"Uploading subjects -- the nitty gritty\" if you want to practice the full approach. To do this go to the workflow you created and under the associated subject set section click on add an example subject set . You should now see the 'kittehs' subject set selected. CONGRATULATIONS! You should have successfully created Kitteh Zoo! To view it, got back to the Build a Project page (by clicking the button in the top right of the page) and then click on the view button next to the new project you have just made.","title":"Upload subjects"},{"location":"getting-started/example/#uploading-subjects-the-nitty-gritty","text":"When you actually build your own project, there won't be an example set of images already loaded for you. Get started uploading a set of subjects for your project by clicking on the \"New Subject Set\" button on the left hand side of the screen. That will bring you to the Subject Uploader . If every subject you want classified is a single image, and if the image file name contains enough information for you to be able to precisely match the subject with the rest of your data later, then this is pretty easy: you can just drag and drop the images into the Subject Uploader (or click within the \"Upload Subjects\" box and choose the files in the pop-up menu) and it will automatically detect that it needs to make subjects out of each file. Much of the time, though, project builders need to keep some data associated with their images in the classification interface. For example, in Kitteh Zoo all the images are Creative Commons licensed and need to have attribution attached when they are displayed. With a simple file called a manifest , we can associate the needed information with each image. Below you can find more details about the manifest in the section DETAILS - Subject sets and manifest details, a.k.a. \"What is a manifest?\" For now we will assume the manifest is created and the files are ready. You can see an example manifest file in the \"Kitteh\" zip file . People often find it easiest to have all of the subject images in a single folder along with a manifest file; you will upload both at the same time. However you organize your files, pay attention to the details and keep records, as it may be important for your data analysis later (e.g. when you download your classifications of subjects and need to know how to correctly link those back to all the rest of your metadata). Click on the \"Upload Subjects\" box and navigate to the \"Kitteh\" folder you downloaded. The easiest thing to do is simply hit cmd + a (on Mac, or ctrl + a on Windows) to select everything in that folder. Note that the subject uploader ignores the excel file and the other folders. Click \"open\" to select those images and the manifest file for upload. The project uploader now indicates that the \"Cat project manifest.csv\" has 30 subjects for upload. (If we had more subjects to upload, we'd do them in batches of no more than 1,000 at a time.) Click \"Upload\" to start the process. When everything is uploaded, you'll see a list of all of the subjects. The numbers to the left are unique identifiers for each subject, and the icons to the right let you preview or delete each subject. Subject sets can be pretty powerful, and sometimes complex. You can have a single subject set that you add to over time, or have multiple subject sets, say, from different years or places. You can have different subject sets for different workflows, but you don't have to. You can even have multiple images in a given subject. For more details and advice on creating and structuring subject sets and associated manifests, check out the details section below.","title":"Uploading subjects - the Nitty Gritty"},{"location":"getting-started/example/#project-builders-manual-the-details","text":"Project : This holds all your project level details. The project name, the people involved, and all the extra content (e.g. text and pictures) you want to share, are all here. Project Details : This is your project's \"behind the scenes\" home page. Start off by naming and describing your project, add a logo and background image. Research Case, FAQ, Results, and Education : You can add a lot of information in these pages to help volunteers better understand the motivation for your project, the best approaches for classifying, and the outcomes of your project. Collaborators : Add people to your team and specify what their roles are so that they have the right access to the tools they need (including access to the project before it's public). Workflows : A workflow is the sequence of tasks that you're asking volunteers to perform. For example, you might want to ask volunteers to answer questions about your images, or to mark features in your data, or both. The workflow is where you define those tasks and set out the order in which the volunteers will do them. Your project might have multiple workflows (if you want to set different tasks for different image sets). Subjects : A subject is a unit of data to be analyzed. A subject can include one or more images that will be analyzed at the same time by volunteers. A subject set consists of a list of subjects (the \"manifest\") defining their properties, and the images themselves. Feel free to group subjects into sets in the way that is most useful for your research. Many projects will find it's best to just have all their subjects in 1 set, but not all: larger projects often find it essential to group subjects into multiple sets.","title":"PROJECT BUILDER'S MANUAL \u2013 THE DETAILS"},{"location":"getting-started/example/#details-workflows","text":"Note that a workflow with fewer tasks will be easier for volunteers to complete. We know from surveys of our volunteers that many people classify in their limited spare time, and sometimes they only have a few minutes. Longer, more complex workflows mean each classification takes longer, so if your workflow is very long you may lose volunteers. Workflow Name : Give your workflow a short, but descriptive name. If you have multiple workflows and give volunteers the option of choosing which they want to work on, this name will appear on a button instead of \"Get started!\" Version : Version indicates which version of the workflow you are on. Every time you save changes to a workflow, you create a new version. Big changes, like adding or deleting questions, will change the version by the number to the left of the \".\": 1.0 to 2.0, etc. Smaller changes, like modifying the help text, will change the integer to the right of the \".\", e.g. 2.0 to 2.1. The version is tracked with each classification in case you need it when analyzing your data. Note: the version looks like a decimal number, but it is not : it is a string with two numbers separated by a \".\" character. So, for example, version 2.1 is not the same as version 2.10. Tasks : There are two main types of tasks: questions and drawing. For question tasks, the volunteer chooses from a list of answers but does not mark or draw on the image. In drawing tasks, the volunteer marks or draws directly on the image using tools that you specify. They can also give sub-classifications for each mark. Note that you can set the first task from the drop-down menu. Main Text : Describe the task, or ask the question, in a way that is clear to a non-expert. The wording here is very important, because you will in general get what you ask for. Solicit opinions from team members and testers before you make the project public: it often takes a few tries to reach the combination of simplicity and clarity that will guide your volunteers to give you the inputs you need. You can use markdown in the main text. Help Text : Add text and images for a pop-up help window. This is shown next to the main text of the task in the main classification interface, when the volunteer clicks a button asking for help. You can use markdown in this text, and link to other images to help illustrate your description. The help text can be as long as you need, but you should try to keep it simple and avoid jargon. One thing that is useful in the help text is a concise description of why you are asking for this particular information. This help information often overlaps with information in the Field Guide, but it is an opportunity to provide extra detail about each specific task.","title":"DETAILS - Workflows"},{"location":"getting-started/example/#details-project-details","text":"Name : The project name is the first thing people will see and it will show up in the project URL.

It's best if it's recognizable even as a small icon. To add an image, either drag and drop or click to open your file viewer. For best results, use a square image of not more than 50KB, but at minimum 100x100 pixels. Background : This image will be the background for all of your project pages, including your project's front page, which newcomers will see first. It should be relatively high resolution and you should be able to read text written across it. To add an image, either drag and drop or click to open your file viewer. For best results, use images of at least 1 megapixel, no larger than 256 KB. Most people's screens are not much bigger than 1300 pixels across and 750 pixels high, so if your image is a lot bigger than this you may find it doesn't look the way you expect. Feel free to experiment with different sizes on a \"typical\" desktop, laptop or mobile screen. Description : This should be a one-line call to action for your project. This will display on your landing page and, if approved, on the Zooniverse home page.

Your project might have multiple workflows (if you want to set different tasks for different image sets). Check this to let volunteers select which workflow they want to work on; otherwise, they'll be served workflow-subject pairs randomly. Checkbox: Private project : On \"private\" projects, only users with specified project roles can see or classify on the project. We strongly recommend you keep your project private while you're still working out its details. Share it with your team to get feedback by adding them in the Collaborators area (linked at the left).

The manifest also allows you to link your classifications back to the rest of your data. A manifest is formatted as a CSV file with 1 line per subject, with the names of images to be associated with a subject on each row (with additional information often included in other fields as well). There is an example in the \"Kitteh\" zip file . The full answer: What we call a \"manifest\" is really just a plain text file with a specific format to each line. To understand the format, let's start with the first few lines from the Kitteh Zoo manifest: image,!origin,link,attribution,license,#secret_description 6672150457_420d61007d_b.jpg,Flickr,https://www.flickr.com/photos/aigle_dore/6672150457,Moyan Brenn,Creative Commons - share adapt attribute,sleepy striped kitteh is unsuspecting of paparazzi 8300920648_d4a21bba59_z.jpg,Flickr,https://www.flickr.com/photos/aigle_dore/8300920648,Moyan Brenn,Creative Commons - share adapt attribute,grandfather kitteh has ear hair. a lot of it 6713782851_82fc8c73e5_z.jpg,Flickr,https://www.flickr.com/photos/hellie55/6713782851,hehaden,Creative Commons - share adapt attribute,juvenile kittehs practice break-in at the catnip factory The first line of the file is a header line that specifies the name of each of the manifest fields. In this case, our manifest has 6 fields (or columns), called \"image\", \"!origin\", \"link\", \"attribution\", \"license\" and \u201c#secret_description\u201d. They are separated by commas: this is what's known as a \"comma separated values\" file, or CSV file. After the first line, each row of the file contains information about 1 subject. The first field, which aligns with the \"image\" header, contains the name of the image that's associated with that subject. This field is critically important as it tells the project builder which images to make into subjects. All the other fields are optional, but in general having more information in the manifest is better. Most projects include additional information in the manifest that helps them match the classifications and subjects to the other data they need for their research. For example, many projects include a separate ID that they have generated and which can be used later as a unique identifier to match classification data to their own metadata (for other projects, the unique identifier is the filename). The additional information in the manifest can also be made available to volunteers as they classify or in the Talk discussion tool (some very keen volunteers find this extremely useful). Any fields with names that begin with \u201c#\u201d or \u201c//\u201d will never be shown to volunteers, such as the \u201c#secret_description\u201d field in Kitteh Zoo. These hidden fields will still be returned to you in the classification file, so you can use these to include information helpful to your research without worrying about whether it might affect the classifications themselves. There might be information that could helpful for the volunteers in discussions or further exploration in the Talk discsussion tool, but could bias the classifications if visible to volunteers while classifying. Any fields with names that begin with \"!\" will not be accessible to volunteers in the classification interface, but will be available on Talk after classification (such as the \u201c!origin\u201d field above). Information in fields that don\u2019t begin with a \u201c#\u201d, \u201c//\u201d, or '!' will always be accessible to volunteers in both the classification interface and the Talk discussion tool. For now, let\u2019s assume you\u2019re just including minimal information, like: my_own_id,the_image 1,kitteh_in_box.jpg 2,kitteh_stalking.jpg 3,kitteh_losing_balance.jpg Note the field names have changed from the previous example. That's because, aside from marking whether a field is hidden or not, it doesn't actually matter to the Zooniverse what the fields are called (or what order they\u2019re in), so you can name and order them according to whatever works best for your project. Using a manifest CSV file also makes it very easy to create subjects with multiple images: my_own_id,image1,image2 1,kitteh_in_box.jpg,kitteh_eating_box.jpg 2,kitteh_stalking.jpg,kitteh_pounced.jpg 3,kitteh_losing_balance.jpg,kitteh_falling_off_sofa.jpg If you upload this manifest plus the 6 images named in it, the Zooniverse software will create 3 subjects with 2 images each. When these subjects come up in the classification interface, volunteers will be able to flash between the images or switch between them manually. Later on, when these subjects are classified, the subject_id assigned by the project builder can be used with a subject export to match each classification back to this information. You can create a manifest file in a simple text editor (such as TextEdit or Notepad), although this method is prone to errors like missed or extra commas. People often find it easiest to create manifest files using spreadsheet software such as Google Sheets, iWork Numbers or Microsoft Excel. Creating and maintaining a manifest using a spreadsheet makes the manifest easy to read, and you can export it to CSV format when you're ready to upload your subjects. You can also open existing CSV files in spreadsheet software. Note: if you have a large subject set it may be cumbersome to manually create a manifest. We suggest using a command-line or other tool to copy-paste a directory list of files into a spreadsheet to help you get started.","title":"DETAILS - Subject sets and manifest details, a.k.a. \"What is a manifest?\""},{"location":"getting-started/glossary/","text":"Glossary A collection of definitions for terms that are used across the Zooniverse. The terms are split into three different categories: General Terms People Project-Specific Terms If you'd like to see a definition that currently isn't on this page, get in touch and we'll look into adding it. General Terms Classification - A classification is all the data associated with a volunteer\u2019s response to an item of data (or subject) they\u2019re presented with whilst going through a project. In essence, a classification is the core unit of human effort produced by the Zooniverse community. Collection - A collection is similar to favoriting an image, but allows volunteers to additionally link together groups of subjects. These collections can be set to either public or private, and you can see all of the public collections on the Collections page. Volunteers can only add to their own collections, and not those of others. Favorites - If a volunteer finds an image on a project that they like and wants to be able to see again in the future, they can mark it as a \u2018Favorite\u2019 by clicking the heart icon underneath it. These images then show on the volunteer\u2019s Favorites page. Newsletter - a brief email message about your project sent to your project's registered volunteers or to a subset of registered Zooniverse volunteers. Newsletters are a great way to update volunteers on the your project's progress and also help give the daily classification rate a boost. If you\u2019d like a newsletter to be sent out for your project, get in touch with Grant Miller, the Zooniverse Communications Lead. Project - A project is a way for our volunteer community to engage with a specific research goal or question, using data provided by the researchers. This gives the researcher data to work with and helps progress science. It takes shape in the form of a website, which includes the main classification interface and the Talk discussion tool . Project Builder - This is the web tool that researchers use to create Zooniverse projects. There is documentation to help with this process on the Project Builder page . Zooniverse - the Zooniverse encompasses the team, website, projects and our codebase. The Zooniverse is an open web-based platform for large\u00ad scale citizen science research projects, capable of supporting tens of thousands of simultaneous users. The Zooniverse hosts the largest collection of online citizen science projects in the world, supporting over 1.5 million registered users and containing projects in astronomy, ecology, humanities, physics, and beyond. People Collaborator - Collaborators are people with permission on a project with full access to edit workflows and project content, including deleting some or all of the project. You can add a collaborator to a project you own through the Collaborators section of the Project Builder . Display name - This is the name that shows up in the Talk boards . You can edit this at any time by going to your Settings page and entering into the appropriate box what you\u2019d like to change it to. Expert - Experts can enter \"gold mode\" to make authoritative gold standard data that will be used to validate data quality. You can add an expert to a project you own through the Collaborators section of the Project Builder . Moderator - this is a role given to allocated by the project owner, and typically given to a member of the project\u2019s volunteer community. The moderator is given extra privileges in the project\u2019s Talk discussion tool (such as the ability to create new discussion boards), and they oversee and help moderate the Talk discussions. You can add a moderator to a project you own through the Collaborators section of the Project Builder . Project owner - This is the person who has built the project using the Project Builder . They are typically the researcher working with the data. Real name - this is the name that will be published alongside any research which involves Zooniverse data from projects you\u2019ve been involved with. Researcher - Members of a project\u2019s research team will be marked as researchers on Talk . You can add a researcher to a project you own through the Collaborators section of the Project Builder . Testers - Testers are people who can view and classify on your project to give feedback while it\u2019s still private. They cannot access the project builder. You can add testers to a project you own through the Collaborators section of the Project Builder . User name - This is the name that you log in with. This is currently permanently associated with your Zooniverse account and your classifications. Volunteer - the Zooniverse\u2019s prefered term for a member of the public who is participating in and contributing to a Zooniverse project. Project-Specific Terms Aggregation - Each subject in a Zooniverse project is independently classified by multiple people. Aggregation is the process of combining these multiple assessments together. Annotation - Annotations are markings, drawings, answers or data about a subject provided by volunteers as part of the classification process. Classification interface - This is the web interface where volunteers are review subjects (subjects being data that volunteers are presented to in projects) and perform the desired project assessments and tasks. Researchers can add in various things to this interface such as tutorials on how to use it, and also mini-courses that give you information about the science behind the project. Each workflow has its own separate classification interface. You can access the classification interface through the main landing page of the project. Export - An export is how to get the volunteer classifications and other relevant information about your project that is stored in the Zooniverse databases. It is essentially a data dump from the Zooniverse database. Project owners and collaborators can request data exports from their projects through the Project Builder. Project data is supplied in CSV/JSON format and Talk data is supplied in JSON format, and the two most commonly used exports are the subject data export, providing all the information stored about the subjects you\u2019ve uploaded for your project, and the classification export, which has information stored for each project classification. You can request a data export by going to the Project Builder , going to the Data Exports tab and then selecting from where whichever data export you\u2019d like, provided you have the right permissions. Field Guide - A field guide is a place to store general project-specific information that volunteers will need to understand in order to complete classifications and talk about what they're seeing. It's available anywhere in your project. It\u2019s different to the tutorial in that the information is generally more about the science behind it, and is a way of sharing knowledge with your volunteers. Field guides are optional and generally contain more information than tutorials. Gold standard data - This is data from classifications made by \u2018Experts\u2019. \u2018Expert\u2019 is a role assigned by the project owner, and their data can be used as a standard to compare the rest of the data against. There is currently an experimental feature which allows you to create a training set and provide in-classification feedback using gold standard data. Landing page - front page of your project\u2019s website. This is where people are directly when they go to your project\u2019s url. The landing page is always accessible from your project\u2019s website by clicking on the project\u2019s avatar. Marks - for drawing tasks, volunteers are asked to highlight content on an image by drawing circles, boxes, etc. around it. These drawings are referred to as marks. Mini-course - this is an educational course that is embedded into the project. It is designed to help teach users more about the science behind projects that they are interacting with. Gravity Spy has one such mini-course. Project Avatar - the project\u2019s logo. This image shows in the top left corner of for the project website. If the project becomes Zooniverse approved, the project avatar will also be listed on the Zooniverse projects page Project Tags - These help define which field of research your project belongs to, and determines which category your project will sit under on the Projects page in the categories section (it will still appear on the main Project page regardless). Users can also search by tag to find projects. Subject - The chunk of data/thing a volunteer on a Zooniverse project is being presented with and asked to review and analyze. It typically is an image, graph, photo, audio recording, video, or a collection of these different things. Subject Set - This is a group of subjects (subjects being data that volunteers are presented to in projects). Subjects are uploaded into subject sets through the Project Builder , and it is subject sets that can be linked to workflows in order to get the desired subjects showing on your project\u2019s webpage. You can group subjects into subject sets however you wish. You might want to group Subjects together, for example to represent a season\u2019s worth of images in Snapshot Serengeti or a particular cell dye staining as in Cell Slider. Talk - is the object-orientated discussion tool associated with your project. Talk enables volunteers to comment on the subjects they've reviewed and promotes discussion amongst the volunteer community. Talk is also a place where the research team and project volunteers can interact. Talk has a series of message boards for longer discussions. Additionally, each subject has a dedicated page on its project Talk where a registered volunteer can write a comment, add searchable Twitter-like hashtags, or link multiple subjects together into groups called collections Talk Tags - Tags are used to help note something as relating to a particular topic. For example, one way of using it would be the following: you\u2019ve found an image that you think would be good for the Daily Zoo , and so you post it in Talk and then include the tag #dailyzoo in the post. This makes it easier for it to be found as a suggestion, because you can do a search for a particular tag using the search bar. A list of popular tags is displayed on the right-hand side of the Talk page and clicking one will take you to instances of that tag in the Talk boards. So for example if you clicked on #dailyzoo, you\u2019d then be shown all the different suggestions that people have made for it that they\u2019ve tagged. Tasks - A task could be listing how many of a particular thing a volunteer sees in an image and then drawing circles around them, identifying the various animals they can see in an image or identifying where abouts in an image something is. There are a wide variety of tools to help create a wide variety of different tasks in the Project Builder tool. One or more tasks make up a workflow. Drawing Task - A task where the volunteers are asked to directly highlight or mark something on an image (e.g. drawing a circle around a penguin if visible in the image presented) Question Task - A task where the volunteers are asked to assess the image and respond to a multiple choice question. In the Project Builder, a question task can allow the volunteer to choose a single response or select multiple answers to the question posed. Sub-task - Sometimes when you are asked to do a task, such as drag a circle around an element in a picture, you are then asked a further task and what is contained in the circle. This is a subtask. For example, you may be asked to circle penguins in an image, a sub-task would be identifying whether the penguin circled is an adult or chick. Survey task - A survey task is a task where you identify something by selection from many options and then are asked a variety of questions about what you\u2019ve just identified, like behaviour, number or color. For example, you could be asked to identify an animal in an image and then answer questions on how many legs you can see, which way it is facing and whether it is an adult or baby. An example of such a project is Camera CATalog . Tools - tools enable volunteers draw or highlight a particular area of a subject image presented on the classification interface (e.g. draw a circle, draw a line, place a pointer). You can design your project such that a single task in the Project Builder can have one or more tools available for volunteers to mark or identify different features found in your subject images. Tutorial - is a very brief walk-through explaining the main goals and aims of your project. It quickly introduces and explains to the volunteer how to do the requested tasks. This is created in the project builder and is presented to first-time volunteers of your project. Project tutorials are optional. Workflow - This is a series of tasks and assessments that a volunteer is asked to do when presented with data in a Zooniverse\u2019s project classification interface. This can be either one task or multiple tasks, depending on the project. Active workflow - these are workflows that are currently being presented to volunteers. They can\u2019t be edited whilst they are active. You can make a workflow active and inactive by ticking the relevant box on the Visibility tab on the Project Builder page. Default workflow - The default workflow is the workflow that appears if the volunteers doesn\u2019t choose one from the offered list on the front page of the project but just clicks on the Classify tab. If a project has more than one active workflow, the project owner and project collaborators can choose which one will be the default workflow. Inactive workflow - Inactive workflows are ones that aren\u2019t currently being shown to volunteers, but can be edited. You can make a workflow active and inactive by ticking the relevant box on the Visibility tab on the Project Builder page. Zooniverse approved project - this is a project that has undergone beta testing and been approved by the Zooniverse team. Details of this process can be found on the Policy Page . Zooniverse approved projects that are currently live can be seen on the Projects page .","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"getting-started/glossary/#glossary","text":"A collection of definitions for terms that are used across the Zooniverse.

In essence, a classification is the core unit of human effort produced by the Zooniverse community. Collection - A collection is similar to favoriting an image, but allows volunteers to additionally link together groups of subjects. These collections can be set to either public or private, and you can see all of the public collections on the Collections page. Volunteers can only add to their own collections, and not those of others. Favorites - If a volunteer finds an image on a project that they like and wants to be able to see again in the future, they can mark it as a \u2018Favorite\u2019 by clicking the heart icon underneath it. These images then show on the volunteer\u2019s Favorites page. Newsletter - a brief email message about your project sent to your project's registered volunteers or to a subset of registered Zooniverse volunteers. Newsletters are a great way to update volunteers on the your project's progress and also help give the daily classification rate a boost. If you\u2019d like a newsletter to be sent out for your project, get in touch with Grant Miller, the Zooniverse Communications Lead. Project - A project is a way for our volunteer community to engage with a specific research goal or question, using data provided by the researchers. This gives the researcher data to work with and helps progress science. It takes shape in the form of a website, which includes the main classification interface and the Talk discussion tool . Project Builder - This is the web tool that researchers use to create Zooniverse projects. There is documentation to help with this process on the Project Builder page . Zooniverse - the Zooniverse encompasses the team, website, projects and our codebase. The Zooniverse is an open web-based platform for large\u00ad scale citizen science research projects, capable of supporting tens of thousands of simultaneous users. The Zooniverse hosts the largest collection of online citizen science projects in the world, supporting over 1.5 million registered users and containing projects in astronomy, ecology, humanities, physics, and beyond.","title":"General Terms"},{"location":"getting-started/glossary/#people","text":"Collaborator - Collaborators are people with permission on a project with full access to edit workflows and project content, including deleting some or all of the project.

Aggregation is the process of combining these multiple assessments together. Annotation - Annotations are markings, drawings, answers or data about a subject provided by volunteers as part of the classification process. Classification interface - This is the web interface where volunteers are review subjects (subjects being data that volunteers are presented to in projects) and perform the desired project assessments and tasks. Researchers can add in various things to this interface such as tutorials on how to use it, and also mini-courses that give you information about the science behind the project. Each workflow has its own separate classification interface. You can access the classification interface through the main landing page of the project. Export - An export is how to get the volunteer classifications and other relevant information about your project that is stored in the Zooniverse databases. It is essentially a data dump from the Zooniverse database. Project owners and collaborators can request data exports from their projects through the Project Builder. Project data is supplied in CSV/JSON format and Talk data is supplied in JSON format, and the two most commonly used exports are the subject data export, providing all the information stored about the subjects you\u2019ve uploaded for your project, and the classification export, which has information stored for each project classification. You can request a data export by going to the Project Builder , going to the Data Exports tab and then selecting from where whichever data export you\u2019d like, provided you have the right permissions. Field Guide - A field guide is a place to store general project-specific information that volunteers will need to understand in order to complete classifications and talk about what they're seeing. It's available anywhere in your project. It\u2019s different to the tutorial in that the information is generally more about the science behind it, and is a way of sharing knowledge with your volunteers. Field guides are optional and generally contain more information than tutorials. Gold standard data - This is data from classifications made by \u2018Experts\u2019. \u2018Expert\u2019 is a role assigned by the project owner, and their data can be used as a standard to compare the rest of the data against. There is currently an experimental feature which allows you to create a training set and provide in-classification feedback using gold standard data. Landing page - front page of your project\u2019s website. This is where people are directly when they go to your project\u2019s url. The landing page is always accessible from your project\u2019s website by clicking on the project\u2019s avatar. Marks - for drawing tasks, volunteers are asked to highlight content on an image by drawing circles, boxes, etc. around it. These drawings are referred to as marks. Mini-course - this is an educational course that is embedded into the project. It is designed to help teach users more about the science behind projects that they are interacting with. Gravity Spy has one such mini-course. Project Avatar - the project\u2019s logo. This image shows in the top left corner of for the project website. If the project becomes Zooniverse approved, the project avatar will also be listed on the Zooniverse projects page Project Tags - These help define which field of research your project belongs to, and determines which category your project will sit under on the Projects page in the categories section (it will still appear on the main Project page regardless). Users can also search by tag to find projects. Subject - The chunk of data/thing a volunteer on a Zooniverse project is being presented with and asked to review and analyze. It typically is an image, graph, photo, audio recording, video, or a collection of these different things. Subject Set - This is a group of subjects (subjects being data that volunteers are presented to in projects). Subjects are uploaded into subject sets through the Project Builder , and it is subject sets that can be linked to workflows in order to get the desired subjects showing on your project\u2019s webpage.

How to Launch your Project A live project can exist in three different states, it may be a: 1. Public Project 2. Review Project 3. Zooniverse Project Each of these project states is discussed below. 1. Public Project Do you have your own crowd of volunteers, or only want members of your collaboration to classify your data? You can make your project public simply by sharing your project\u2019s URL with those you want to take part. If you're planning a big public launch, or you think your project might attract significant attention, you should let us know so we can support you properly. Please note, there is a limit of 10,000 subjects per user - contact us if you'd like to host more. 2. Review Project If you would like the Zooniverse volunteer community to contribute to your project, the first step is to apply for review. You can do this in the project builder by clicking the \u201cApply for review\u201d button within the \u201cVisibility\u201d section. At this point, your project is considered a \u201cReview Project\u201d. Your project will then be subject to two stages of review \u2013 firstly, the Zooniverse team will check your project complies with Zooniverse rules (see below). Typically, we will respond to you within two weeks. If successful, your project will then be shared with a group of volunteer project testers who will provide feedback. We will contact you when a slot becomes available for volunteer review (this currently takes one to four weeks). Once your project has been shared with our volunteer project testers, the majority of project feedback is typically received within a week. This will be made immediately accessible to you. During this process you should address the formal feedback provided by the volunteer project testers, as well as any comments on your project\u2019s Talk discussion pages. Any technical issues can be reported to us via the GitHub repository , but please consider carefully any comments on workflow design. It is important you review the results produced at this stage to ensure they are of sufficient quality for your research. If they aren\u2019t, please consider re-approaching your project design, make any changes, and submit for review again. 3. Zooniverse Project Once your project has been successfully reviewed and you have a final version of your project, you can apply for your project to be launched as an official Zooniverse project. To do this, notify the team by email at contact@zooniverse.org. Your project will then undergo a final review process. This may include requesting information from you about your plan for using the results, and examining the results from the review phase. We may also carry out a peer review of your project. This review process can take a variable amount of time, from weeks to months. Once the project has passed review, it will appear in the Zooniverse project list . We will consider including your project in our Zooniverse Newsletter and other promotional material.

Per workflow weighting However, we also have support to tweak this process. It\u2019s possible to assign weights to subject sets, so subjects in set A have a proportionally higher chance of getting shown compared to set B. Because subjects retire and subject sets have different amounts of subjects in them, it is possible to set weighting up in two different styles: A fixed chance per subject set. For instance, subjects in set A will always have a 60% chance of being shown to a volunteer, and subjects in set B will always have a 40% chance of being shown, regardless of how many subjects actually are in set A. A practical use of this would be to show gold-standard training images to volunteers for 30% of the shown images, even though there might only be 20 training images in the project. Once those 20 training images have all been seen by a user, they would of course not be shown again, providing a natural automatic stop to training. A fixed chance for each individual subject in a set. This is still configured at the per subject set level, but the weight is now applied at a per-subject basis, i.e. relative to all of the other available subjects in the workflow. With this you can make it twice as likely for a subject to be shown. A practical use for this is when you have new data available, but the previous dataset isn\u2019t fully complete yet. By increasing the relative weight of the old subjects, you can make sure that the subjects in the old subject sets have a high chance of still getting their last few classifications needed for them to proceed to retirement, while still making the new subjects available for classifying as well. Per user weighting It\u2019s also possible to set these same parameters up on a per-user basis. This overrides the configuration at the workflow level. A practical use for this is to use heuristics to detect users with a high accuracy in certain types of subjects, and giving these users a higher chance of seeing certain subjects. This is an advanced use case which combines various features.
